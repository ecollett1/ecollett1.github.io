The children were seized and then bound. The oldest of the children was carried while tied to the stripped 
trunk of a pine tree. The second child was muzzled with a muzzle made of knotted willow and they put a rope 
around its neck as a leash, while the third child walked beside them, gloomy and disturbing.

...

Tyr had been kind to the muzzled and leashed pup. Tyr had scratched its neck and its head and played with 
it, removing its willow muzzle before long. It was a wolf cub, black as the starless night, etched with 
coal gray, with watchful eyes the color of silverleaf.

The wolf cub ate its meat raw, but began to speak as a man would speak, in the language of men and the gods. 
Fenrir was growing and he grew fast. One day the size of a wolf, the next the size of a cave bear, then the 
size of a great elk.

The gods were intimidated by his fierceness and strength, all except Tyr. Tyr continued to play with Fenrir, 
teaching him and feeding him each day. Each day the wolf ate more than the day before. Each day it grew and 
became stronger and fiercer. Odin's visions were full of foreboding and fear of the great wolf. The wise-one 
determined that Fenrir must be bound.

...

Heavy chains and shackles were forged and presented by the gods to Fenrir.
"You have grown so fast, Fenrir. It is time to test your strength. We have here the heaviest chains and shackles. 
Do you think you can break them?"
"I think I can," rumbled Fenris Wolf. "Bind me."
The gods bound the great wolf with the chains and shackled his paws. Fenrir waited patiently.
"Now!" shouted Thor.
Fenrir strained with his might and the chains snapped into tiny pieces.
The great wolf howled in triumph and the moon shook. "I broke your chains and I broke them easily." Fenrir's fur 
ruffled and his eyes gleamed. "Do not forget this."
